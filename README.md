### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   BEM

### What I learned

I learned to pay close attention to images for overlays. I spotted the difference in the Our Creations section and initially missed the overlay in the header.

I also got some practice with my mobile menu, adding a small fade-in animation and making sure it closed when the viewport expanded.

### Continued development

-   More animations
-   Improving BEM skills
